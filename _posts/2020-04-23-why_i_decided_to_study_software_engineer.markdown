### I have to admit Software Engineering was never on my to-do list or in my career plans. I honestly never realized the field is as broad as it is and reachable for those without advance Computer Science degrees and several years of experience. When I originally pictured the field, I would think of NASA workers or some high tech cyber security operation. Never did I realize the importance of having a Software Engineer for an establishment as common as a small business until recent years. 

### When I first began college I studied Criminal Justice/Accounting in hopes to become a Lawyer, FBI agent, or Forensic Accountant. Soon after graduating and working in the Criminal Justice field at juvenile & correctional facilities for over 3 years I quickly realized that it did not bring me true happiness or a sense of purpose. So, I went back to school for my Masters in Business Administration, launch my first business venture, wrote a few books and worked full-time in the Administration Field. While working as an entrepreneur and in the administration field, I was exposed to so many different departments I began to gain an interest in Technology and realized the natural skillset that I could develop even further. After creating my first website, I then began creating websites for several other friends and their businesses. Then I began creating graphic designs, newsletter editing, photo/video editing for both personal and professional use. Although I loved my role in administration, I found I am happiest in my life when I am creating things. Technology allowed me to not only create things but it also gave me a sense of purpose when I can see the things that I have created bring joy to other people lives. 

### This leads me to answer the question: Why did I decide to study Software Engineering? It is simple, because I love to create and bring joy to others through my creativity. The moment I realized that the future would be mostly technology focused I knew that I wanted to be a part of something that will continue to grow with an added bonus of job security. Software Engineering however, is more complex than just creating things. You must be one that is skilled in problem solving, working with teams, thinking outside the box, and the ability to evolve as the world continues to evolve at a fast pace. For me, these requirements line up with what I look for in a career, as I love being a life long learner. Despite the challenges and moments of insecurity while in the process of learning, I am motivated by many other young women that have been where I am and have continued to push through the typical stereotype of a Software Engineer. I believe many others have paved a way for me to pursue this dream and I plan do the same as well. 

### My plans as I develop in this industry are to begin working full-time as a Developer, grow in my skills, and teach others how to code. In addition to the hard work, I am look forward to the job flexibility, work-life balance, and the new network of people I will meet on this journey. So I ask you, why not be a Software Engineer?
