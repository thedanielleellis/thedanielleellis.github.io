##### For my second project at Flatiron School I developed a content management app called ReadTrack. It is designed to assist parents with keeping track of the books their children read. I was inspired to create this app since I previously designed/published a children's reading journal and thought it would be nice to have an electronic version. In the app the parent is able to record the child's name, age, book, author, page count and reading level. The app follows  the Model View Controller (MVC) design pattern and the create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) functions for logging books.  

##### Starting this project was a little challenging for me because it took time to ensure that each route coincided with the other. The process was very frustrating but to see the program up and running properly made it very much worth it. 

## My Process 
##### I began the project by downloading the Corneal gem, which saved so much time with the prefixed libraries. I then created a notes file to outline my process which included:

#### * Interfaces (user can create, read, update, and delete a book log) 

#### * User class (attributes: username, email, password) 

#### * Book class (attributes: chlid_name, child_age, book_title, authors_name, page_count, reading_level )

#### * User controller (/signup & /login) 

#### * Book controller (CRUD) 

#### * Sessions (enable sessions)

#### * Authentication (has_secure_password & password_digest) 

##### After getting these mapped out I was able to start my project! Overall, I enjoyed working through the complications of this project and learned a lot. I am ecstatic that I can  look at my code and actually read and understand the language since several months ago it looked like a foreign language. This project has really got me excited and looking forward to building more apps when I know that after the rain (process) there is always a rainbow (hope).
