For my Javascript Project I chose to create a quiz application that allows the user to create a username then be asked a series of quiz questions. In preparing the project I began with an outline that consisted of my User Stories, MVP (Minimum Value Product), Stretch Goals, Mock-up, and listed my Domain Models. 

One of our requirements was to build the app as a Single Page Application. As I began building the project I noticed some key difference between the single page and multiple page application. 

The Single Page Application is an app that works inside a browser and does not require the page to reload during use. It requests the data independently and renders the page straight in the browser. It is fast and efficient. However, in the Multi-Page Application every change renders a new page from the server in the browser.  

Before deploying a web application it is important to consider the goal of it in order to choose between the single page vs multi-page. Multi-page is good for online shops while single page is effective for the quiz application I have built. 

Before learning the process behind coding these two types of pages, I have always saw websites built both ways but never really noticed that there was a difference. Learning what goes on behind the scene of a web application has definitely opened my mind to the amazing unique features of the web.
