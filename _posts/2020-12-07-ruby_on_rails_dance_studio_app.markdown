For my Ruby on Rails project I chose to create a virtual dance studio name ***Virtual Dance Machine***. This project is inspired by my love of dance and hopes of having a dance studio one day in the future. Due to the current state of the country, having a virtual dance studio will be beneficial for those who love to dance but from the safety of their own home. This application allows users to view current dance classes and their associated category, add a dance class, comment on the dance class, and view all categories. 

> Since preparation is one of the most important details to follow, I began my project by drafting a concept and the schema attributes. Since I knew what I wanted my app to do this was pretty simple. The models are: Dancer (as user), Category, Dance Class, and Comments.

### Understanding Rails Process

> (1). User makes a request to URL (2). request hits the Rails router in config/routes.rb (3.) The controller received the request and processes it (4.) The controller receives and asks the model to fetch from database (5.) Model returns data to the controller action (6) Controller action passes data to views (7) Views renders page as HTML (8) Controller sends HTML back to browser

Memorizing every single code is nearly impossible. This is why it is important to have a basic understanding of how Rails work, how to find the information, and where to place it. This basic cycle posted above has helped me through creating my app and fixing errors. I love that in Rails when an error is displayed, it's pretty straightforward where the error occurred especially with the ability to trace the routes. The challenging part is not trying to be as smart as a computer, it's trying to be as brainless as a computer. This means, the computer will only do what you tell it to. So when an error occurred, instead of getting frustrated, I told myself:  "I must have told the computer to do this, let me tell it to do something else." Eventually through trial and error, it worked out! 

Although very challenging, this project was a lot of fun to build especially viewing the results from the app when it's not crashing! I look forward to continuing my learning process.
